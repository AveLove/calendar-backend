and pay attention, all inhabitants of the land.<br>
Did anything like this ever happen in your days<br>
or in the days of your ancestors?<a name="fnB2" href="joe_note.htm#fn2"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a><br>

<bqverse 3>3 Tell your children<a name="fnB3" href="joe_note.htm#fn3"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a> about it,<br>
and have your children tell their children,<br>
and their children the following generation.<a name="fnB4" href="joe_note.htm#fn4"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a><br>

<bqverse 4>4 What the <i>gazam</i>-locust left the <i>`arbeh</i>-locust consumed,<br>

<bqverse 5>5 Awake, you drunkards,<a name="fnB6" href="joe_note.htm#fn6"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a> and weep!<br>
Wail, all you wine drinkers,<a name="fnB7" href="joe_note.htm#fn7"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a><br>
because of the sweet wine,<br>
for it is removed from your mouth.<br>

<bqverse 6>6 For a nation<a name="fnB8" href="joe_note.htm#fn8"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a> has come up against<a name="fnB9" href="joe_note.htm#fn9"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a> my land,<br>
a nation powerful and too many to count.<br>
Its teeth are those<a name="fnB10" href="joe_note.htm#fn10"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a> of a lion;<br>
its incisors are those of a lioness.<a name="fnB11" href="joe_note.htm#fn11"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a><br>

<bqverse 7>7 It has desolated my vines;<a name="fnB12" href="joe_note.htm#fn12"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a><br>
my fig trees it has left in splinters.<br>
It has stripped them completely bare and thrown them aside.<br>
Their twigs are left whitened by exposure.<a name="_Toc494012943"></a></ul><p><i>A Call to Lament</i>

<bqverse 8>8 Wail<a name="fnB13" href="joe_note.htm#fn13"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a> like a young virgin<a name="fnB14" href="joe_note.htm#fn14"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> clothed in sackcloth,<br>
because of the death of her husband-to-be.<a name="fnB15" href="joe_note.htm#fn15"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a><br>

<bqverse 9>9 Both the grain offering and the drink offering have been removed<br>
from the temple<a name="fnB16" href="joe_note.htm#fn16"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a> of the LORD.<br>
The priests, the attendants of the LORD, <br>
are engaged in mourning.<br>

<bqverse 10>10 The fields<a name="fnB17" href="joe_note.htm#fn17"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> have been utterly destroyed.<a name="fnB18" href="joe_note.htm#fn18"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a><br>
The land is in mourning,<br>
because the grain has been destroyed.<br>
The fresh wine has dried up;<br>
the olive oil languishes in depletion.<br>

<bqverse 11>11 Be embarrassed, farmers;<br>
wail, wine dressers,<br>
because of the wheat and the barley.<br>
For the harvest of the field is destroyed.<br>

<bqverse 12>12 The vine is dried up;<br>
the fig tree languishes,<br>
the pomegranate and date and apple<a name="fnB19" href="joe_note.htm#fn19"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a> as well.<br>
In fact, all the trees of the field are dried up.<br>
Indeed, joy has dried up<br>
from humankind!<a name="fnB20" href="joe_note.htm#fn20"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a><br>

<bqverse 13>13 Put on sackcloth and lament, you priests!<br>
Wail, you attendants at the altar!<br>
Come, spend the night in sackcloth,<br>
you servants of my God!<br>
For grain offerings and drink offerings are withheld <br>
from the temple of your God.<br>

<bqverse 14>14 Announce a holy fast;<br>
proclaim a sacred assembly.<br>
Gather the elders<br>
and all the inhabitants of the land<br>
to the temple of the LORD your God,<br>
and cry out to the LORD.<br>

<bqverse 15>15 Alas for that day!<br>
For the day of the LORD is near;<br>
it will come like destruction from the Sovereign One.<a name="fnB21" href="joe_note.htm#fn21"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a><br>

<bqverse 16>16 Is it not the case that right before our eyes<br>
the food has been cut off?<br>
From the temple of our God<br>
joy and rejoicing have also been cut off!<a name="fnB22" href="joe_note.htm#fn22"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a><br>

<bqverse 17>17 The grains of seed have shriveled<br>
beneath their shovels.<a name="fnB23" href="joe_note.htm#fn23"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a><br>
Storehouses have been decimated,<br>
and granaries have been torn down,<br>
for the grain is dried up.<br>

<bqverse 18>18 How the animals groan!<br>
Herds of cattle wander in confusion,<br>
because they have no pasture.<br>
Even the flocks of sheep have endured suffering.<br>

<bqverse 19>19 To you, O LORD, I call.<br>
For a fire<a name="fnB24" href="joe_note.htm#fn24"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>25</SUP></FONT></a> has consumed<br>
the pastures of the wilderness.<br>
A flame has set ablaze<br>
all the trees of the field.<br>

<bqverse 20>20 Even the animals of the field<br>
long for you.<a name="fnB25" href="joe_note.htm#fn25"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>26</SUP></FONT></a><br>
For the river beds are dried up.<br>
A fire has consumed<br>
the pastures of the wilderness.

<bqverse 1>1 </b>Blow the trumpet<a name="fnB26" href="joe_note.htm#fn26"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></a> in Zion;<br>
sound the alarm signal on my holy mountain!<br>
Let all the inhabitants of the land shake with fear,<br>
for the day of the LORD is about to come.<br>
Indeed, it is near!<br>

<bqverse 2>2 A day of darkness and gloominess,<br>
a day of cloud and heavy overcast,<br>
like blackness<a name="fnB27" href="joe_note.htm#fn27"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></a> spread over the mountains.<br>
A people<a name="fnB28" href="joe_note.htm#fn28"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT></a> numerous and powerful--<br>
there has been nothing like it from ancient times,<br>
and it will not be repeated<br>
for many generations!<br>

<bqverse 3>3 A fire devours before this people;<a name="fnB29" href="joe_note.htm#fn29"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT></a><br>
a flame blazes behind them.<br>
The land is like a garden before them;<br>
but behind them there is only a desolate wilderness--<br>
nor is a survivor to be found in it.<br>

<bqverse 4>4 Their appearance is similar to that of horses;<a name="fnB30" href="joe_note.htm#fn30"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT></a><br>
they run along like horsemen.<br>

<bqverse 5>5 Their skipping about on the mountain tops<br>
is like the noise of chariots,<br>
like the sound of a blazing fire<br>
consuming stubble,<br>
like an army that is powerful<br>
and lined up for battle.<br>

<bqverse 6>6 Peoples<a name="fnB31" href="joe_note.htm#fn31"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT></a> writhe in fear before it.<br>
All faces pale with fright.<a name="fnB32" href="joe_note.htm#fn32"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT></a><br>

<bqverse 7>7 They run like warriors;<br>
like soldiers<br>
they scale the wall.<br>
Each one proceeds on his course;<br>
they don't alter<a name="fnB33" href="joe_note.htm#fn33"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></a> their path.<br>

<bqverse 8>8 None interferes with his fellow.<br>
Each one advances along his trajectory.<br>
Though they fall on weapons,<a name="fnB34" href="joe_note.htm#fn34"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT></a><br>
they don't alter their course.<br>

<bqverse 9>9 They dart about in the city;<br>
they run on the its wall.<br>
They climb up the houses;<br>
they go in through the windows like a thief.<br>

<bqverse 10>10  The earth quakes before this people;<a name="fnB35" href="joe_note.htm#fn35"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT></a><br>
the sky reverberates.<br>
The sun and the moon grow dark;<br>
the stars refuse to shine.<br>

<bqverse 11>11  The LORD utters his voice<br>
before his army.<br>
Indeed, his battle camp is very large;<br>
he causes his word to be powerful.<br>
Yes, the day of the LORD is great<br>
and very marvelous--who can endure it?<a name="_Toc494012945"></a></ul><p><i>An Appeal for Repentance</i>
<br>
<bqverse 12>12  "So now," the LORD says,<br>
"return to me with all your heart<br>
and with fasting, weeping, and lamentation.<br>
Tear your hearts,<a name="fnB36" href="joe_note.htm#fn36"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT></a><br>
and not just your garments!"<br>

<bqverse 13>13  Return to the LORD your God,<br>
for he is merciful and compassionate.<br>
He is slow to anger and displays boundless loyal love;<br>
he relents from sending calamitous punishment.<br>

<bqverse 14>14  Who knows? Perhaps he will grant a reprieve<a name="fnB37" href="joe_note.htm#fn37"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT></a> and be compassionate<br>
and leave blessing in his wake--<br>
A meal offering and a drink offering<br>
for the LORD your God!<br>

<bqverse 15>15  Blow the trumpet<a name="fnB38" href="joe_note.htm#fn38"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT></a> in Zion.<br>
Announce a holy fast;<br>
proclaim a sacred assembly.<br>

<bqverse 16>16  Gather the people;<br>
sanctify an assembly.<br>
Gather the elders;<br>
gather the children<br>
and the nursing infants.<br>
Let the bridegroom come out from his bedroom<br>
and the bride from her private quarters.<a name="fnB39" href="joe_note.htm#fn39"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT></a><br>

<bqverse 17>17  Let the priests, the attendants of the LORD, <br>
weep between the porch and the altar,<br>
and let them say, "Have pity, O LORD, on your people;<br>
don't turn over your inheritance to be mocked,<br>
to become a proverb among the nations.<br>
Why should it be said among the peoples,<br>
"Where is their God?"<a name="_Toc494012946"></a></ul><p><i>The LORD's Response</i>
<br>
<bqverse 18>18 Then the LORD became zealous for his land;<br>
he had compassion on his people.<br>

<bqverse 19>19 The LORD responded to his people,<br>
"Look! I am about to send to you<br>
grain, new wine, and olive oil.<br>
You will be fully satisfied.<br>
I will not deliver you over again<br>
to be an object of mockery among the nations.<br>

<bqverse 20>20 I will remove the one from the north<a name="fnB40" href="joe_note.htm#fn40"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></a> far from you.<br>
I will push him back to a land<br>
that is desolate and devastated.<br>
I will turn his face to the eastern sea<br>
and his back to the western sea.<a name="fnB41" href="joe_note.htm#fn41"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT></a><br>
His stench will rise up<br>
as a foul smell."<a name="fnB42" href="joe_note.htm#fn42"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT></a><br>
Indeed, the LORD<a name="fnB43" href="joe_note.htm#fn43"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT></a> has accomplished great things.<br>

<bqverse 21>21 Don't fear, my land!<br>
Rejoice and be glad,<br>
because the LORD has accomplished great things!<br>

<bqverse 22>22 Don't fear, wild animals,<a name="fnB44" href="joe_note.htm#fn44"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>19</SUP></FONT></a><br>
for the pastures of the wilderness are green with grass.<br>
Indeed, the trees bear their fruit;<br>
the fig tree and the vine yield to their fullest.<br>

<bqverse 23>23 Citizens of Zion,<a name="fnB45" href="joe_note.htm#fn45"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>20</SUP></FONT></a><br>
rejoice and be glad<br>
in the LORD your God!<br>
For he has given to you<br>
the early rains<a name="fnB46" href="joe_note.htm#fn46"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT></a> for your vindication.<br>
He has sent to you the rains--<br>
both the early and the late rains<a name="fnB47" href="joe_note.htm#fn47"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>22</SUP></FONT></a> as formerly.<br>

<bqverse 24>24 The threshing floors are full of grain;<br>
the vats overflow with new wine and olive oil.<br>

<bqverse 25>25 I will restore to you the years<a name="fnB48" href="joe_note.htm#fn48"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>23</SUP></FONT></a><br>
that the <i>`arbeh</i>-locust consumed,<a name="fnB49" href="joe_note.htm#fn49"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>24</SUP></FONT></a><br>
the <i>yeleq</i>-locust, the <i>hasil</i>-locust, and the <i>gazam</i>-locust--<br>
my great army, that I sent against you.<br>

<bqverse 26>26 You will eat to your fill;<br>
you will praise the name of the LORD your God,<br>
who has acted wondrously in your behalf.<br>
My people will never again be put to shame.<br>

<bqverse 27>27 You will know that I am in the midst of Israel.<br>

Your sons and daughters will prophesy.<br>
Your elderly will dream dreams;<br>
your young men will see revelatory visions.<br>

<bqverse 29>29 Even on male and female servants<br>
I will pour out my Spirit in those days.<br>

<bqverse 30>30 I will produce portents both in the sky<a name="fnB53" href="joe_note.htm#fn53"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>28</SUP></FONT></a> and on the earth--<br>
blood, fire, and columns of smoke.<br>

<bqverse 31>31 The sun will be reduced to darkness<br>
and the moon to the color of blood,<a name="fnB54" href="joe_note.htm#fn54"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>29</SUP></FONT></a><br>
before the day of the LORD comes--<br>
that great and terrible day!<br>

<bqverse 32>32 It will so happen that everyone who calls on the name of the LORD will be delivered.<a name="fnB55" href="joe_note.htm#fn55"  class="BQNote"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>30</SUP></FONT></a><br>
